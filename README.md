# WorldWidePhoneNumberEditText
### Motivation 
I was developing an Android application for a client that requires the user to provide its phone number to which it will send an OTP (one time password) to login. At the first time I check on github to see if I can find a library that allows me to accept phone number from the World. I found many, but any of them didnâ€™t satisfy my requirements.
I understand this may be the situation of many other developers like me, for this reason I create this highly customizable library that allows you to accept and verify phone number form the entire world.
